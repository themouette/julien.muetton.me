It was a long journey with countless twists and turns.

I started right after my internship, as the only developer, exploring web
technology while creating what became the first prototype of **t-resa**, our
product.

Cash was short, so I contracted for a year and a half in web related research
services. You can find more information in [dedicated](/resume/experiences/experience-efixo) [pages](/resume/experiences/experience-orange-r-d)

It took 2 years to have a working prototype that allowed raising money.

I hired 1, then 2 and finally 3 trainees to teach them all I know for a few
months. Trainees turned into employees and a new sales department was created.
Prototype became product, while sales were having hard times.

Back at contracting to pay bills as sales where giving us hard time, we tried
more and more ways.

In the end we didn't make it to the market, being unable to find the right
angle, but it was an experience ! All employees and myself had great
opportunities, so it was time to move on.

If you ask me, first thing to do before building a product, is to make sure you
know how to sell it !
