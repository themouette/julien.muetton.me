  Set up a dynamic UI for small business server.

  Neuf Pass is an embedded business server providing Internet gateway, a
  router, a PBX and contact management.

  My mission was to rebuild the settings interface to have a “netvibes like”
  portal.

  I learned about **linux**, **C** and **scaling frontend applications**.

The Neuf Pass box provides in one device an Internet gateway, a router, and a
PBX with contact providing.

My mission was to rebuild the settings interface to have a “netvibes like”
portal. I specified a C api serving XML, interface relies on prototype and XSLT
transformation (thanks to sarrissa) was used to render data in portlets.

Since then Efixo became part of SFR (French telecoms operator) and I never used
prototype again.

I learned a lot about javascript performances, client side templating and
circular references. It was my **dive into linux** experience.
