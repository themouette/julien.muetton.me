  Gandi.net is a domain name registrar and hosting provider based in France.

  I was hired to work on the migration of the perl monolith to a modern solution.
  The frontend team grew from 4 to 10 people during my time there, while the
  backend was migrated to python microservices, we (the frontend team) chose to
  use React and (as soon as it was released) redux for the frontend.

  I worked on the project core features, such as project build, monorepo
  tooling, NodeJS server with server-side rendering, while being assigned to the
  hosting product.
