description: |
  [Clermontech](http://clermontech.org) aims at animating Clermont-Ferrand's
  developer network.
  To achieve this goal, we organize conferences called **"API Hours"** and
  developer lunches.

  I left the organization in 2019 since I moved from Clermont-Ferrand to an
  orchard in Brittany.
