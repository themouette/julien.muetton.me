Gadget Factory was part of the widget specification team. As javascript
developer I was in charge of coaching 2 junior developers and create gadgets
ordered by business partners.

Soon job started to repeat itself, so I created a framework to quickly develop
multi-platform gadgets (OSX dashboard, Vista sidebar, bubbletop (orange netvibes
clone) and iGoogle). The framework is based on company standards: ANT, Eclipse
and custom javascript libraries. Development time has been reduced by 90% and
the team won the 2008 “new territory” Orange Award (there is 7 awards
worldwide).

I wrote http://jsexperience.blogspot.fr blog to share my experiments.
