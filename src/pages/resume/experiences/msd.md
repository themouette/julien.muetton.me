## Everyday

Part of a team or by myself, I participated in maintenance actions and
automatism projects.

## Performance evaluation protocols update.

Create indicators to anticipate critical performances issues during production
line life. Identifying critical conditions for each part of the process and find
ways to monitor.

## Configuration management software

Using Access and VBA, developed a tool to manage references of all the machine
components across all the production lines.

## School project

DSP based codec to try multi channel encoding. Theory was that compress
instruments separately would be more effective than compressing a single
masterized track.

## Conclusion

Pharmaceutical industry means the highest standards of quality insurance in
every move. I learned that **quality can be a matter of life or death.**
