I've been using Git since 2010, helped several teams to adopt it, and gave a
few talks about it.

Git is a wonderful tool to leverage collaboration.
Whatever your production workflow is, it fits. Even when SVN is around,
you can use [git-svn](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html)

Coupled with [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/) or [Github](https://github.com) you
can do peer reviews, merge requests and encourage the discussion.
