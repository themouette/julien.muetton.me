## 2013 PHP Courses

My co-teacher and me chose to teach web applications using php as media. It
includes **HTTP protocol**, **ORM** and common patterns such as IOC and
routing.

Have a look at
the [slides](http://williamdurand.fr/licpro-php-slides/#slide1).

## 2014 and 2015 Frontend Courses

After this first year, I was offered to teach the frontend technologies.

It was a great opportunity to put everything in perspective and give a cohesive
view of the web technologies.

Have a look at the
