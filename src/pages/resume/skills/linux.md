Command line addict, I use vim as primary editor and my system of choice is Debian.

I used to use puppet to manage my dotfiles ([available on
github](https://github.com/themouette/puppet-me)) it helped me bootstrap
vagrant's machines (one per project).

Now that Vagrant is no more part of my workflow (I rely on Docker for
reproducible environment), my dofiles are available in my [dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/themouette/dotfiles).
